Luana Carrilho is a visiting researcher from Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), where he is doing a PhD in the Operations Research area.

My research is focused on developing models under uncertainty for solving parallel machine scheduling problems with uncertain processing times through robust optimization approaches.

In my previous research, I applied a more efficient time-dependent formulation, called bucket-indexed formulation, for real-world rig scheduling instances, and this formulation reached goods good computational times.
