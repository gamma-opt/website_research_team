abstract: 'Despite methodological advances for modeling decision problems under uncertainty, faithfully representing endogenous uncertainty still proves challenging, both in terms of modeling capabilities and computational requirements. A novel framework called Decision Programming provides an approach for solving such decision problems using off-the-shelf mathematical optimization solvers. This is made possible by using influence diagrams to represent a given decision problem, which is then formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. In this paper, we focus on the type of endogenous uncertainty that received less attention in the introduction of Decision Programming: conditionally observed information. Multi-stage stochastic programming (MSSP) models use conditional non-anticipativity constraints (C-NACs) to represent such uncertainties, and we show how such constraints can be incorporated into Decision Programming models. This allows us to consider the two main types of endogenous uncertainty simultaneously, namely decision-dependent information structure and decision-dependent probability distribution. Additionally, we present a decomposition approach that provides significant computational savings and also enables considering continuous decision variables in certain parts of the problem, whereas the original formulation was restricted to discrete variables only. The extended framework is illustrated with two example problems. The first considers an illustrative multiperiod game and the second is a large-scale cost-benefit problem regarding climate change mitigation. Neither of these example problems could be solved with existing frameworks.'
